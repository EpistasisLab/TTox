## Compound-toxicity datasets

+ [`compound_toxicity_data_similarity/`](compound_toxicity_data_similarity/) contains boxplots that compare different types of pairwise similarity between compounds. Four types of pairwise similarity were compared: i) compounds within whole dataset ('all vs all'), ii) compounds within training set ('train vs train'), iii) compounds within testing set ('test vs test'), and iv) between compounds in testing set and compounds in training set ('test vs train'). Two types of similarity metrics were adpoted: i) maximum Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('Maximum similarity'), ii) average Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('Average similarity').
