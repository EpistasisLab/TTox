## Compound-toxicity datasets

+ [`compound_toxicity_data_similarity/`](compound_toxicity_data_similarity/) contains boxplots that compare different types of pairwise similarity between compounds. Four types of pairwise similarity were compared: i) compounds within whole dataset ('all vs all'), ii) compounds within training set ('train vs train'), iii) compounds within testing set ('test vs test'), and iv) between compounds in testing set and compounds in training set ('test vs train'). Two types of similarity metrics were adpoted: i) maximum Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('Maximum similarity'), ii) average Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('Average similarity'). 

+ [`compound_target_feature_select_tuning/`](compound_target_feature_select_tuning/) contains visualization results of feature selection hyperparameter tuning on ccompound-target iteraction datasets. Two types of compound-target datasets were included: datasets with molecular descriptor features (file name that starts with 'descriptor_all') and datasets with MACCS fingerprints features (file name that starts with 'fingerprint_maccs'). Two types of visualization results were included: i) boxplot that compares model performance of different hyperparamter settings (file name that ends with 'compare.pdf'. Note: only one hyperparameteris compared in each file. Model performance shown in two adjacent boxes have the same setting except one hyperparameter.), and ii) scatter plot compare testing performance of selected features with testing performance of all features (file name that starts with '_testing_performance_compared.pdf').
