## Compound structure-toxicity datasets

+ [`compound_toxicity_data_similarity/`](compound_structure_toxicity_data_similarity/) contains boxplots that compare different types of pairwise similarity between compounds.
  + Four types of pairwise similarity were compared: 
    + compounds within whole dataset ('all vs all')
    + compounds within training set ('train vs train')
    + compounds within testing set ('test vs test')
    + between compounds in testing set and compounds in training set ('test vs train')
  + Two types of similarity metrics were adpoted:
    + maximum Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('Maximum similarity')
    + average Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('Average similarity')

## Compound structure-target binding datasets

+ [`compound_target_feature_select_tuning/`](compound_target_feature_select_tuning/) contains visualization results of feature selection hyperparameter tuning on compound-target iteraction datasets. 
  + Two types of compound-target datasets were included:
    + datasets with molecular descriptor features (file name that starts with 'descriptor_all')
    + datasets with MACCS fingerprints features (file name that starts with 'fingerprint_maccs') 
  + Two types of visualization results were included:
    + boxplot that compares model performance of different hyperparamter settings (file name that ends with 'compare.pdf'. Note: only one hyperparameteris compared in each file. Model performance shown in two adjacent boxes have the same setting except one hyperparameter.)
    + scatter plot compare testing performance of selected features with testing performance of all features (file name that starts with '_testing_performance_compared.pdf') 

+ [`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/) contains visualization results of feature selection pipeline implementation on all compound-target iteraction datasets. The naming scheme of files is the same as files in [`compound_target_feature_select_tuning/`](compound_target_feature_select_tuning/).
  + Two types of compound-target datasets were analyzed: 
    + datasets with molecular descriptor features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_analysis/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_analysis/))
    + datasets with MACCS fingerprints features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_analysis/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_analysis/))

+ [`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/) also contains visualization results of feature similarity analysis among feature selection-derived models. 
  + Two types of models were analyzed:
    + models built upon datasets with molecular descriptor features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_compare/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_compare/))
    + models built upon datasets with MACCS fingerprints features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_compare/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_compare/))
  + Three types of visualization results were included:
    + boxplot that compares the intragroup/intergroup distribution of pairwise similarity scores among models of different classes (file name that ends with 'similarity_boxplot.pdf')
    + boxplot that compares the distribution of testing performance across models of different protein function class (file name that ends with "by_class.pdf")
    + boxplot that compares the distribution of testing performance across models of measurement types (file name that ends with "by_measure.pdf")	
  + Models were grouped into different classes by two standards: 
    + unit that compound-target binding was measured in (file name that contains 'measure')
    + functional class that target belongs to (file name that contains 'function')
  + Four different thresholds of testing performance (measured by R squared) were applied to choose models:
    + 0 (file name that contains 'mc_0')
    + 0.25 (file name that contains 'mc_0.25')
    + 0.5 (file name that contains 'mc_0.5')
    + 0.75 (file name that contains 'mc_0.75')
