## Compound-toxicity datasets

+ [`compound_toxicity_data/`](compound_toxicity_data/) contains generated structure property-toxicity outcome datasets for machine learning task. Four types of organ toxicity were included: cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, and renal. Two types of structure properties were included: molecular descriptors (file name that contains 'descriptor_all') and MACCS fingerprints (file name that contains 'fingerprint_maccs'). Three types of data were generated: i) whole dataset (file name that ends with 'whole_data.tsv'), ii) dataset for training purpose (file name that ends with 'train.tsv'), and iii) dataset for testing purpose (file name that ends with 'test.tsv'). A brief summary of the datasets can be found [here](compound_toxicity_data/offsides_compounds_descriptor_all_toxicity_whole_data_summary.tsv) and [here](compound_toxicity_data/offsides_compounds_fingerprint_maccs_toxicity_whole_data_summary.tsv).

+ [`compound_toxicity_data_similarity/`](compound_toxicity_data_similarity/) contains computed structure similarity results between compounds. Four types of pairwise similarity were computed: i) compounds within whole dataset, ii) compounds within training set, iii) compounds within testing set, and iv) between compounds in testing set and compounds in training set. Two types of similarity metrics were adpoted: i) maximum Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('max_tc'), ii) average Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('mean_tc').
