  + Four types of organ toxicity were included: 
    + cardiac
    + hepatic
    + pulmonary
    + renal 
  + Two types of structure properties were included:
    + molecular descriptors (file name that contains 'descriptor_all')
    + MACCS fingerprints (file name that contains 'fingerprint_maccs') 
  + Three types of data were generated:
    + whole dataset (file name that ends with 'whole_data.tsv')
    + dataset for training purpose (file name that ends with 'train.tsv')
    + dataset for testing purpose (file name that ends with 'test.tsv')
  + A brief summary of the datasets can be found [here](compound_structure_toxicity_data/offsides_compounds_descriptor_all_toxicity_whole_data_summary.tsv) and [here](compound_structure_toxicity_data/offsides_compounds_fingerprint_maccs_toxicity_whole_data_summary.tsv).

+ [`compound_structure_toxicity_data_similarity/`](compound_structure_toxicity_data_similarity/) contains computed structure similarity results between compounds.
  + Four types of pairwise similarity were computed:
    + compounds within whole dataset
    + compounds within training set
    + compounds within testing set
    + between compounds in testing set and compounds in training set
  + Two types of similarity metrics were adpoted:
    + maximum Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('max_tc')
    + average Tanimoto Coefficient across all possible pairs ('mean_tc') 

## Compound structure-target binding datasets

The naming scheme of result files is the same as files in [`compound_target_feature_select_tuning/`](compound_target_feature_select_tuning/). 

+ [`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/) also contains analysis results of feature selection pipeline implementation. 
  + Two types of compound-target datasets were analyzed:
    + datasets with molecular descriptor features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_analysis/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_analysis/))
    + datasets with MACCS fingerprints features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_analysis/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_analysis/)) 
  + Five types of analysis results were included: 
    + basic statistics of feature selection models (file name that ends with '_feature_selection_statistics.txt')
    + prediction results of unseen data using built upon all features (file name that ends with 'prediction_all_features.tsv')
    + prediction results of unseen data using built upon selected features (file name that ends with 'prediction_select_features.tsv')
    + identified structure feature-target relationships (file name that ends with 'target_structure.tsv')
    + identified structure feature-target-measurement relationships (file name that ends with 'target_measurement_structure.tsv')

+ [`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/) also contains computed pairwise similarity scores of selected relevant features among different models. 
  + Two types of models were analyzed:
    + models built upon datasets with molecular descriptor features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_compare/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/descriptor_all_compare/))
    + models built upon datasets with MACCS fingerprints features ([`compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_compare/`](compound_target_feature_select_implementation/fingerprint_maccs_compare/)) 
  + Four different thresholds of testing performance (measured by R squared) were applied to choose models: 
    + 0 (file name that contains 'mc_0')
    + 0.25 (file name that contains 'mc_0.25')
    + 0.5 (file name that contains 'mc_0.5')
    + 0.75 (file name that contains 'mc_0.75')
   
## Compound target-toxicity outcome datasets

+ [`compound_target_toxicity_data/`](compound_target_toxicity_data/) contains generated compound target-toxicity outcome datasets for machine learning task. The naming scheme of result files is the same as files in [`compound_structure_toxicity_data/`](compound_structure_toxicity_data/). In addition, four types of target sets were used as features in all the datasets:
    + targets from binding prediction models with testing performance greater than 0 (file name that contains 'mc_0')
    + targets from binding prediction models with testing performance greater than 0.25 (file name that contains 'mc_0.25')
    + targets from binding prediction models with testing performance greater than 0.5 (file name that contains 'mc_0.5')
